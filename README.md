#HotelManagement
Hotelmanagement-code that i wrote in C++-coding course.

The program lets you choose either one person hotel room or two person room. You can choose a room number. The reservation are made by name, hotel room number and by nights. Then the program will inform you the exact cost for the reservation. When you have made the reservation, you can search your reservation ( or someone else) by the name on the reservation. Very simple program. Nothing too complex.
