#HotelManagement
This C++ program is designed to manage hotel reservations with a simple and user-friendly approach. Users can choose between a single-person or double-person hotel room and specify a room number for their booking. Reservations are recorded with the guest's name, the room number, and the number of nights they plan to stay. The program then calculates and displays the total cost of the reservation.

Once a reservation is made, users can search for it by the guest's name, making it easy to retrieve booking details. The program focuses on simplicity and efficiency, offering a straightforward solution for basic hotel reservation needs.
